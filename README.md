Developed a suite of games designed to help children's affected by disabilities. 
These games are synchronised with a wireless EEG wearable device used to register the children brain activities. 
Analysing the brainwaves data, using Machine Learning, has then been possible to correctly classify with 96.9% accuracy if a 
child is affected or not by autism. <br>

A Demo demonstration of the games in actions can be found [here.](https://pierpaolo28.github.io/Projects/diss.html)
